################
###SRC_DIR = Directory to the ANIMAL-SPOT Source Code Repository
################  
src_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###DEBUG = Activate/Deactivate additional logging information during training procedure (recommended). 
###In case of deactivation the logging level is set to "Info" which does not provide such detailed information than "Debug". 
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
debug=true

################
###MODEL_PATH = Path of the trained and saved network model (.pk file)
################  
model_path=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/ANIMAL-SPOT.pk

################
###LOG_DIR = Directory where the logging file, named PREDICT.log, will be stored.
################
log_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###OUTPUT_DIR = Directory where the output prediction file(s) and visualizations (if activated, see visualize option) are stored.
################
output_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###SEQUENCE_LENGTH = Prediction sequence length in milliseconds. The network will get an input of a given sequence length
###in order to predict/classify this particular frame (sliding window approach). Consequently each classification hypotheses involves
###the same temporal context, which should be similar to the selected sequence length during training.
################
sequence_len=0.30

################
###HOP = Hop size in milliseconds. The network will get an input of a given sequence length
###in order to predict/classify this particular frame and afterwards the window is moved by the given hop size (sliding window approach).
################
hop=0.10

################
###THRESHOLD = network confidence threshold, which has to be higher than this particular defined threshold in order to consider
###a network hypothesis as true/valid. Everything below will be conisdered as noise. A threshold can be desinged in a way that
###as many vocalization events as possible should be detected, or as less false alarms as possible should be made (trade-off).
################
threshold=0.75

################
###BATCH_SIZE = The amount of spectrograms which will be processed within one batch. Batch size values during prediction are always set to 1.
################
batch_size=1

################
###NUM_WORKERS = The amount of workers while predicting spectral information. This option is only supported in Linux and MacOS due to Windows
###multi-processing restrictions. During prediction this value has to be set to 1. In Windows this value has to be set to 0.
################
num_workers=1

################
###NO_CUDA = When this option is deactivated and a GPU is available the model will predict GPU-based (much faster!). In case this option is activated
###the model will ignore GPU-based predictioin independent of the hardware.
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
no_cuda=true

################
###VISUALIZE = Enable visualization option, which will visualize and store spectrograms for each given frame within the given output directory.
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
visualize=false

################
###JIT_LOAD = Dependent on the selected jit_save option during training, this value has to be set equivalent in order to properly load the model.
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
jit_load=false

################
###MIN_MAX = defines the type of normalization within the data preprocessing procedure. There exist two different types of normalization - 0/1-dB-normalization and min-max-normalization
###If this option is activated min-max-normalization is conducted. Otherwise 0/1-dB-normalization is applied, using the given reference and minimum dB values. This value has to equivalent
###to the value during training in order to not mix up two different types of nomralization techniques during training and prediction
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
min_max_norm=false

################
###LATENT_EXTRACT = Additional extraction of hidden layer information (one layer before final output layer), by creating a pickle file at the chosen ouptut directory named animal-spot-classifier.p including the following
###information: filenames, features, spectrogram input
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
latent_extract=true

################
###INPUT_FILE = input data which should be predicted via the network. It can be either a path to a given audio file (.wav), or a path to a directory only containing .wav files 
################
input_file=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/audio.wav
