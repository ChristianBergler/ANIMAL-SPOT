################
###SRC_DIR = Directory to the ANIMAL-SPOT Source Code Repository
################
src_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###DEBUG = Activate/Deactivate additional logging information during training procedure (recommended). 
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false). In case of deactivation the logging level is set to "Info"
###which does not provide such detailed information than "Debug". 
################
debug=true

################
###DATA_DIR = Directory to the prepared data material 
################
data_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###CACHE_DIR = Directory where cached spectrograms will be stored. During network training, each processed
###spectrogram can be cached while setting this option. This speeds up all upcomming training sessions, because
###the spectrograms can be directly loaded from this cache direcotry (occupies storage, speed up training). By
###default this is "None", and therefore caching is disabled.
################
cache_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###MODEL_DIR = Directory where the final network/model will be stored. 
################
model_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###CHECKPOINT_DIR = Directory where training checkpoints will be stored. Checkpoints are important to load model weights and restart training
###from an existing checkpoint, rather than starting from scratch. 
################
checkpoint_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###LOG_DIR = Directory where the logging file, named TRAIN.log, will be stored.
################
log_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###SUMMARY_DIR = Directory where all the summary files will be stored. Summary files include all the information about the entire training procedure
###(e.g. various machine learning metrics, spectrogram images, and other important figure) which can be loaded to tensorboard (see README - section Network Evaluation). 
################
summary_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###NOISE_DIR = Directory where all the .wav excerpts are stored which will be used for noise augmentation during training. If this option is not set,
###noise augmentation will not be performed during training. According to the data, it has to be decided whether noise augmentation has a benefit,
###and should be activated or not, e.g. original noise-heavy and faint animal vocalization might be eliminated because of noise augmentation. 
################
noise_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###START_FROM_SCRATCH = Start taining from scratch, i.e. do not use any kind of given checkpoint to restore.
################
start_from_scratch=true

################
###MAX_TRAIN_EPOCHS = Maximum number of epochs to train the network. By default 500 epochs are set. However, based on previous experience 100 to 150 maximum
###training epochs is a good number.
################
max_train_epochs=1

################
###JIT_SAVE = After training is finished the network can be saved via two options, either via torch.jit.save or torch.save.
###Dependent on the future use-case of the network it might be saved with either of the two options. By default this option is deactivated.
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
jit_save=false

################
###EPOCHS_PER_EVAL = The amount of epochs after which the model is evaluated on the validation set. By default this is 2, meaning that after 2 epochs of training,
###the model will be evaluated on the validation set, in order to verify and observe the performance.
################
epochs_per_eval=2

################
###BATCH_SIZE = The amount of spectrograms which will be processed within one batch. Batch size values between 4 and 32 are recommended.
###By default a batch size of 16 is used.
################
batch_size=16

################
###NUM_WORKERS = The amount of workers while loading the spectral information. This option is only supported in Linux and MacOS due to Windows
###multi-processing restrictions. Multi-processing is disabled while setting num_workers to zero. By default 8 workers are chosen (values between 1 and 8 are recommended).
###However, this is not affecting training speed when using a GPU. Moreover, when using the caching option, the network will significantly speed
###up the initial data loading after successfully caching all spectrograms in the first run.
################
num_workers=8

################
###NO_CUDA = When this option is deactivated and a GPU is available the model will train GPU-based (much faster!). In case this option is activated
###the model will ignore GPU-based training independent of the hardware.
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
no_cuda=false

################
###LR = Learning rate for updating weights in after each backpropagation step. This parameter has a strong influence regarding network performance. By default
###a learning rate of 10e-5 is selected, which suits for most of the cases. In general, an increase of the batch-size and learning rate should be done consistently and vice versa.
###Usually the learning rate is within a range of 0.1 (10e-2) and 0.000001 (10e-6), which is recommended to stay in this value range. Combined with the recommended batch size
###the default value of 10e-5 can be used. However, changes within the learning rate (within the recommended range) can be made, in order to observe the impact with respect 
###to the final network performance.
################
lr=10e-5

################
###BETA1 = This value will be used by the Adam-optimizer to control the decay of the moving averages. More detailed information about the Adam-optimizer can be found in the literature. ###By deafault a beta1 value of 0.5 is set, together with a fixed beta2 value of 0.999. The default value is suitable for most scenarios. However, valid values for beta1 are numbers ###between 0.5 up to 0.9.
################
beta1=0.5

################
###LR_PATIENCE_EPOCHS = Decay the learning rate after N/epochs_per_eval epochs without any improvements on the validation set. According to the chosen value regarding the
###epochs_per_eval option, the learning rate will be decayed by a factor (see lr_decay_factor option). By default this value is 8, together with the default value
###of the 2 concerning epochs_per_eval, resulting in a learning rate decay after 4 epochs without any improvements on the validaton set (accuracy as metric reference).
################
lr_patience_epochs=8


################
###LR_DECAY_FACTOR = The learning rate decay factor, reducing the learning rate after a given number of epochs (see lr_patience_epochs)
################
lr_decay_factor=0.5

################
###EARLY_STOPPING_PATIENCE_EPOCHS = An early stopping criteria in order to avoid network overfitting acting as a regulariztaion technique. The entire network training 
###will be stopped in case there are no improvements on the validatoin set for more than the amount of early_stopping_patience_epochs (default: 20) divided by epochs_per_eval (default: 2)
################
early_stopping_patience_epochs=20

################
###FILTER_BROKEN_AUDIO = Filter all audio files which are below a minimum loudness of 1e-3 (float32) before the final data split and network training. These files will be stored within
###a generated back-up (bck) folder and not considered for model training
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
filter_broken_audio=true

################
###SEQUENCE_LENGTH = During training a fixed sequence length (amount of time) is used. This is specified via the sequence_length option. All files will be either zero-padded, in case
###the original file is too short, or randomly sub-sampled in case the original audio is too long. Consequently each training clip represents a temporal context, equalt to this value.
###This value is given in milliseconds. According to the species-specific target signals, this parameter has to be set in a way to represent the average duration length of the
###corresponding animal vocalizations. Consequently this parameter is highly animal-specific and needs to be adjusted for each species. By default the value is set to 500ms.
################
sequence_len=500

################
###FREQ_COMPRESSION = In order to reduce memory usage, all input spectrograms are frequency compressed. Therefor a frequency range (fmin-fmax) is mapped onto a give number of
###frequency bins (see option n_freq_bins). The method of compression can be either set to "linear" (default), "mel", or "mfcc". Experience over many different species 
###has shown that the linear compression works best.
################
freq_compression=linear

################
###N_FREQ_BINS = The number of frequency bins representing a given frequency range (fmin-fmax). The larger the number of selected frequency bins, the greater the memory usaged
###due to larger network input spectrograms. If the selected FFT window size, which defines the maximum number of frequency bins, is smaller than the selected n_freq_bins number, the 
###final network input spectrogram will be interpolated and in the other case compressed.
################
n_freq_bins=256

################
###N_FFT = This option represents the FFT window size in samples. The larger the FFT windows size the better frequency resolutions can be obtained. However, time resolutions get worse
###while increasing this parameter. Smaller FFT window sizes lead to a better time but worse frequency resolution. Consequently there exist a trade-off between the two versions, 
###dependent on the respective use-case. While considering the animal-specific signal characteristics a proper FFT window size has to be determined. By default it is set to 1024 samples.
###According to the information in the manuscript, different FFT sizes are visualized for different species, giving an intuation of a proper value (usually values using a power of 2, e.g
###128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096).
################
n_fft=1024

################
###HOP_LENGTH = This option represent the FFT hop length, which is mainly responsible for the amount of resulting time bins. The amount of time bins can be obtained by:
###sequence_length/1000 * sampling_rate/hop_length (e.g. 500ms/1000ms * 44100Hz/172samples) ~ 128 time bins. Together with the obtained n_freq_bins, this is the final 
###size of the input data, e.g. 128x256. All experiments have been made with this shape, showing promising results. However, different input shaps are possible.
###Using the previous formula allows to design a hop_length which results in a certain amount of time frames (note: the ResNet arichtecture compress data by a factor of 2,
###so input shape dimensions of a power of 2 does not result in rounding problems while compression, e.g. 128x256 -> 64x128 -> 32x64 -> 16x32 -> 8x16)
################
hop_length=172

################
###SAMPLING_RATE = sampling rate in order to resample given input data. In case sampling rate is equal to the original sampling rate, no resampling will be performed. Default: 44100 Hz
################
sr=44100

################
###AUGMENTATION = if this parameter is activated random intensity, time, and pitch augmentation within a certain range is conducted during training only. If noise augmentation
###should be conducted this parameter has to be activated. In case it is deactivated, the enire augmentation pipeline is not utilized.
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
augmentation=true

################
###RESNET = defines the network architecture, including different ResNet options, e.g. 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152. Depending on the selected value the corresponding ResNet model
###is build. For ANIMAL-SPOT only ResNet18 was used, which provides the best inference and training times, as well as promising results, even with respect to deeper/larger network models.
################
resnet=18

################
###CONV_KERNEL_SIZE = defines the kernel size for the initial square ResNet convolution. Different kernel sizes can be selected (default: 7, according to the original ResNet 
###implementation). However, other valid kernel sizes are: 3, 5, 9 
################
conv_kernel_size=7

################
###NUM_CLASSES = defines the number of classes. In case of a binary detection scenario this value is equal to 2. In case of a multi-class species/call type classification scenario
###this value has to be set according to the existing number of classes
################
num_classes=2

################
###MAX_POOL = defines wheter the initial max-pooling within the ResNet architecture is conducted or not. There are three different option: setting the value to 1 activates max
###pooling according to the original ResNet implementation. Setting the value to 0, deactivates max-pooling but setting a stride of 2 within the first convolution of the first 
###ResNet block in order to end up with the same output shape as max-pooling would be activated. Setting the value to 2 deactivates max-pooling and does not apply a stride of 2, as 
###option 2. Consequently the output shape does not change, compared to option 0 and 1. In order not to lose too much resolution at an early stage, max-pooling was disabled in all 
###experiments (no stride either, option 2). According to previous experience, this led to the best results.
################
max_pool=2

################
###MIN_MAX = defines the type of normalization within the data preprocessing procedure. There exist two different types of normalization - 0/1-dB-normalization and min-max-normalization
###If this option is activated min-max-normalization is conducted. Otherwise 0/1-dB-normalization is applied, using the given reference and minimum dB values.
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
min_max_norm=true

################
###FMIN = defines the minimum frequency covered within the spectral network input representation. Every frequency below is ignored within the spectrogram.
################
fmin=500

################
###FMAX = defines the maximum frequency covered within the spectral network input representation. Every frequency above is ignored within the spectrogram.
